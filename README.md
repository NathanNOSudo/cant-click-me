This is a great exercise for learning about form validation and interacting with the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScrip

This code works by setting up event listeners on the form's inputs and the submit button.

The input event listener checks the form fields and updates the error messages accordingly. If there are any errors, it moves the submit button.

The click event listener for the button prevents the form from being submitted unless all the fields are filled out correctly. If the form is incomplete or contains errors, the button moves. If everything is filled out correctly, it alerts that the form has been submitted.

Please, note that this is a basic implementation and does not cover all the possible edge cases. In a real-world scenario, you might want to implement more robust form validation and user interaction.
